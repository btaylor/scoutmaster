About Scoutmaster's use of Django

Outwardly, it would appear that scoutmaster is a django project, and that's
partially true.  Scoutmaster uses Django's world-class ORM, and operates itself
inside of a Django management command, but that's where the alignment with
Django ends.  Scoutmaster does not require a webserver, and will not render
pages if you use the runserver command.
